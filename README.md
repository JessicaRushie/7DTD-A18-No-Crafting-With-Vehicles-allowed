This is a MOD for 7 Days To Die Alpha 18.

This is inspired by "JaWoodle" aka "Josh" from YouTube.

It removes crafting from the game so you cannot craft anything. Excluding Vehicles as you cannot find them in the world!
This version allows you to craft all the vehicles in a workbench. The materials are the same.
(There is a different MOD that does not allow vehicle crafting on my page https://github.com/JessicaRushie )

This adds another level of difficulty as you have to loot everything including all building materials.
Yes thats right... all of them! However, if you can find Wood Frames or Rebar Frames you can use them however you like!

<HOW TO>
Simply place the unzipped file into your 7 Days To Die\Mods Folder.
EG, "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\7 Days To Die\Mods"

The file it should look like this,
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\7 Days To Die\Mods\Jessicas No Crafting Vehicles allowed\Config\recipes.xml
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\7 Days To Die\Mods\Jessicas No Crafting Vehicles allowed\Modinfo.xml

_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________
You are free to use this MOD any way you like,
however i would like credit if it's used in a MOD Pack and such as it took me quite a long time to make.

Hope you enjoy.
